//the for loop

i=0 //initialization
say "hey" if i<3 //condition if true it will keep giving until it's false
increase i by 1 //final expression

0 "hey"
1 "hey"
2 "hey"
3

//this is how you would accomplish if you were talking to the computer in english

//in code it works like this:

for (initialization, condition, final expression) {
    console.log("hey");
}

//which will be the following for the code:

for (var i=0; i<3; i++) {
    console.log("hey");
}
