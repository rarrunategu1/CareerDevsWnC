['item 1', 'item 2', 'item 3']
//An array is a "list" in programming. Every item in an array
//should have quotation marks and the list should start and end in a bracket.
//Pressing enter from here will give you the array which should be the following:

["item 1", "item 2", "item 3"]
//this array is stored somewhere but it's kind of lost.
//To get it back we need to give the array a "nickname" as you'll see below:

var todos = ["item 1", "item 2", "item 3"]
//The "nickname for this array of items is "todos".  To create the nickname
//give it the prefix var and after the nickname put the equal sign.  This way
//when you type in todos, it will bring up the array of items as you'll see below:

todos 
//will return
["item 1", "item 2", "item 3"]
